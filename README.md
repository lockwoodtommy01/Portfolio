# Portfolio

In this assignment, we had the task of creating our portfolio webpage using the skills we have learned with HTML and CSS. On this website there is an "about me" section, as well as a section for future projects to be shown, and a contact section with links to my Github, Twitter, Instagram, email, and phone number.
